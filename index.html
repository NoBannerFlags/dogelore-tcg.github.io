        Welcome to the website for Dogefighters: The Dogelore Trading Card Game! All of the articles will be written by me (Doge) and my pals (Walter, Cheems and Perro.) On this site, you can download the game and play it, visit our wiki and learn about our developers. Such wow, very fun. You could try to play with friends, but I doubt you have any. (Many roast, such funny.) Walter asked me to say that he likes the gameplay, the different modes, the art, fire trucks and moster trucks. I donâ€™t blame him. Wow, many doge.
